Welcome to the Task Management Application!

To use, please download all items in this directory first. Remember to download the pictures folder as all images are included in there.

The home page will start you at the beginning of the site. It includes a register button at the bottom for new users, but also please note both the register and the login html page's include a link above their forms.

The Task Dashboard will include links to go to the details page and the edit/create a new task page. In the create new task form (on the taskedit page), you have the option to also set the priority and add a due date but it is not required. Only the title of the task is required!
